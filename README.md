# sql-challenge
This repo contains all files and code related to the SQL homework assignment.

In this assigment I am applying what I have learned about data modeling, data engineering, and
data analysis.
__________________________________________________________________________________________
All of this work is being done in postgresql. The items in this repo include the following:
1. A set of csv files with related data.
2. An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that was used to create the tables in the database.
3. A database titled "employees_db".
4. A set of queries used to display data from the tables in the database.

Here is a brief listing of the work I completed in this assignment.
1. Reviewed the data in the csv files to make sure it was "whole".
2. Used the data files to create an ERD.
3. Used the ERD to create a database in postgresql.
4. Wrote different queries to view data from the tables in the data base.

Data Analysis
The queries I wrote completed the following analysis items.
1. Detailed list of employees (includes; employee number, first name, last name, sex, and salary)
2. List of all employees hired in 1986
3. Complete list of all deparment managers
4. Complete list of employees and their department
5. List of employees that have the first name of "Hercules" and a last name that starts with "B"
6. Complete list of employees who work in the Sales department
7. Complete list of employees that work in the Sales and Development departs.
8. A list of unique last names for all employees, the frequency of the last name, in
descending order.

Code for all queries can be foundin the sql_queries.sql file.
